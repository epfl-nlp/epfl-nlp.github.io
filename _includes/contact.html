        <p class="text-muted"><strong>I will be taking on new PhD students next year!</strong> Apply if you're interested in joining EPFL to work with me. Before you can be considered for the NLP lab, however, you will have to be admitted to the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/edic-computer-and-communication-sciences/edic-computer-and-communication-sciences/edic-how-to-apply/">EDIC program</a>, which handles admissions centrally. Feel free to let me know if you apply, but I unfortunately can't conduct pre-screenings until applications are in.</p>
